                            Committing to a four year university may find seem like a major accomplishment and stress reliever 
                            as you no longer have to deal with high school; however, the reality is that the real pressure is only 
                            getting started. At a prestigious college such as the University of California, Los-Angeles, not only do 
                            students have to compete and strive for good grades, they have to worry about clubs, and more importantly, 
                            the classes they need to take to graduate. As a student myself, I understand that coursework 
                            itself is taxing enough; I donâ€™t want to have to constantly meet up with counselors, 
                            maintain an updated Google doc, and surf through the UCLA coursework website to formulate a 
                            four-year plan that will inevitably change throughout my years at college. 
                            </p>

                            BruinPlanner is an interactive application for UCLA students to help design a 4-year plan. UCLA has always 
                            struggled with presenting course requirements and requisites due to them having too many websites with 
                            unnecessary information such as outdated 4-year plans. Instead, if students had an interactive 4-year planner, 
                            where they could select their major and visually see what the required classes and their respective 
                            prereqs are, it would save them a lot of time and pain. This website allows students to create an account 
                            that would give them access to 4-year planners based on a major in which they could organize their classes 
                            based on requirements.
                            </p>

                            BruinPlanner is my first ever full stack web application! It was created using the MERN stack and extracts UCLA course
                            data from the UCLA DevX Api (<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="http://api.ucladevx.com/" style={{color: "blue"}}>http://api.ucladevx.com/</a>). In addition, the website utilizes many open-source npm packages/libraries 
                            such as passport, bcrypt, and react-dnd. A majority of this project was created individually receiving only very minor assistance 
                            from my UCLA Computer Science Peers.

                                in a particular programming language(s). Overall, I had lots of fun, gained tons of knowledge, and exceeded many of
