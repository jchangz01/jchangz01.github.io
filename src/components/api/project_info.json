            "Committing to a four year university may find seem like a major accomplishment and stress reliever as you no longer have to deal with high school; however, the reality is that the real pressure is only getting started. At a prestigious college such as the University of California, Los-Angeles, not only do students have to compete and strive for good grades, they have to worry about clubs, and more importantly, the classes they need to take to graduate. As a student myself, I understand that coursework itself is taxing enough; I donâ€™t want to have to constantly meet up with counselors, maintain an updated Google doc, and surf through the UCLA coursework website to formulate a four-year plan that will inevitably change throughout my years at college.",
            "BruinPlanner is an interactive application for UCLA students to help design a 4-year plan. UCLA has always struggled with presenting course requirements and requisites due to them having too many websites with unnecessary information such as outdated 4-year plans. Instead, if students had an interactive 4-year planner, where they could select their major and visually see what the required classes and their respective prereqs are, it would save them a lot of time and pain. This website allows students to create an account that would give them access to 4-year planners based on a major in which they could organize their classes based on requirements.",
            "BruinPlanner is my first ever full stack web application! It was created using the MERN stack and extracts UCLA course data from the UCLA DevX Api (http://api.ucladevx.com/). In addition, the website utilizes many open-source npm packages/libraries such as passport, bcrypt, and react-dnd. A majority of this project was created individually receiving only very minor assistance from my UCLA Computer Science Peers."

            "Being in a worldwide pandemic, teaching mathematics has certainly become a struggle for both students and teachers. We have all been in that one Zoom call where your math teacher is trying to explain some sort of concept, and due to the lack of tools available, it simply isn't a good time for anyone.",
            "Inspired from the lack of math functionality on most video chat platforms, our team created a web application focused on accommodating students and teachers alike for their math needs. ScribblMath is a video chatting platform that implements the staples of video chat like webcams and a chat, but also adds elements that are crucial to conveying complex mathematics in an easy way. These primarily include a virtual drawing board as well as LaTeX math typesetting support in the chat box! This means that your teacher will no longer have to spend hours trying to type out the correct math equation or attempt to draw the ten symbols that each of the equations has that you learned that day. It will look just like the way it does in your textbook!!",
            "The client-side of ScribblMath was constructed using the React framework, while the server-side was written using the Express framework. With a partner, we originally intented this project to be a submission for the Covid Hacks 2020 Hackathon but have decided to continue revising and improving it. My focus on this web application is the frontend UI."

            "GooberEats is a simple delivery logistics system that loads and indexes geospatial data (latitude and longitude data for streets in the UCLA/Westwood area) and then uses this data to produce delivery plans and navigation instructions.",
            "This project resembles an UberEats GPS (without the UI) where an optimal delivery path is generated given the starting point, endpoint, and food drop-off points. It implements data structures such as a Hash Map and Hash Function to load and store a text file of GeoCoordinates (latitude and longitude) and StreetSegments (a pair of connected latitude/longitude coordinates associated with a street name) in a given region. Using an open hash map, we can map GeoCoordinates to StreetSegments and achieve an O(1) time complexity for lookup. With this fast search speed, GooberEats utilizes the path search algorithm, A* to generate an optimal point to point route between two GeoCoordinates. Given this list of GeoCoordinates, it associates pairs of latitude and longitude coordinates to create a list of StreetSegments and then outputs this data into textual GPS navigation instructions such \"Proceed north on Broxton Avenue for 0.08 miles\". This algorithm is repeated for a sequence of point to point deliveries ordered using a simple estimation technique to avoid having to deal with the time complexity of the Traveling Salesmen Problem, O(n!) but still provide an efficient delivery order.",
